            <p id="introduction">I am a general engineering student who has a passion for game development since childhood. I started programming in 2017 with Arduino, mode creation on Roblox as well as a 3 hour per week training on blender and Unity 3d, during a school year. I really started game development in 2019 with my first mobile game. Since this training, I learned all aspects of game development by myself. A majority of projects below and all assets that compose them are the result of a personal work. You can click on some application icon to see a trailer.</p>
