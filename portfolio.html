It uses the same gameplay as the classic Pac-Man with some differences. You would pay attention to collisions between players which cause loss of life, to bonuses which does not necessarily transform players into berserker mode, but which can also give an extra life or a score bonus. The different exits of the map don’t necessarily lead to the opposite exit, it’s random.</p>

                    <p id="description">This project is a rework of Space Escape, my first game: an escape game developed in 2017. The rework touches the code, UI, sounds and design, but the main goal still the same. In this horror game, your objective will be to explore an abandoned building in order to recover all artefacts therein and survive. However, evil spirits rode. Be careful, listen well, and eliminate them. With each attempt, the number of enemies, traps and knives as well as their positions change. Another thing, you only have 3 lives.</p>

                    <p id="description">As part of a school project called ‘technical project’, our goal was to design a programmable pill dispenser. It was capable of dispensing a patient’s drug treatment. To do this, an application was developed on Unity in C# in order to communicate (via cable or bluetooth) with the pill dispenser running under Arduino. The application allows you to set the frequency of treatments, to follow the drug reserves in the pill dispenser and to enable a light and/or sound alarm when taking the treatment to alert the patient. The pill dispenser was designed on 3D Experience and printed with a 3D printer.</p>
